<p>I am fluent in the standard web stack of HTML5, CSS and Javascript as well as common web tools such as Wordpress.</p>

<p>I have a keen interest in the emerging power of APIs and new models of development based around javascript, such as node.js and Angular.</p>

<p>One of my most valuable skills is the development of workflows and understanding how systems can be joined, combined and work together to provide solutions that suit the user.</p>
