<p>I am a fluent user of a number of key applications such as <strong>Illustrator</strong>, <strong>Photoshop</strong>, <strong>InDesign</strong>, <strong>Premiere</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Office</strong>.</p>

This inlcudes writing in <strong>Markdown</strong> and adopting a more mobile friendly workflows that include mobile and web applications like <strong>Evernote</strong>, <strong>Dropbox</strong> and <strong>Google suite</strong> of tools.</p>
