<p>The mLearn Project at Charles Sturt University (CSU) is an attempt to establish a new philosophy for large-scale institutional initiatives that borrows aspects from the technology companies based out of Silicon Valley. This paper will outline the concepts that have been adopted as well as the rationale for this change in tact. The project is running in 2012 and into 2013 over three teaching sessions and it is hoped will foster innovation through trials of technology, mobilising system access and developing mobile enhanced learning resources. Findings and reflections from the project will be published over the next 18 months.</p>
