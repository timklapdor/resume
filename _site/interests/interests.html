<p>I am a keen <strong>Photographer</strong> espeically of landscape and portraiture that capture the essense of a moment in time. I love <strong>International Travel</strong> and seeing and experiencing the wide world we call home. The infintie permeability and creativity shown in <strong>Obscure Music Fusions</strong>. As the chef at home I prefer the concept of <strong>Gourmet Eating</strong> rather than cooking and enjoy the adventure of tasting the weird and wonderful world of food.</p>
