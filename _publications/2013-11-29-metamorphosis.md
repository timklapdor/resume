This paper aims to explore the conceptual work being undertaken at Charles Sturt University to develop The Adaptive Digital Publishing Engine (TADPOLE). The aim of the project is to envision a distinct way of creating, structuring and publishing educational resources for delivery to a wide variety of platforms and media. The development of TADPOLE will allow us explore a 21st century approach to publishing that embraces digital affordances and uses metamorphosis, rather than translation or transcription, to convert content from one format to another.
