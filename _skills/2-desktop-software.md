I am a fluent user of a number of key applications such as **Illustrator**, **Photoshop**, **InDesign**, **Premiere** and **Microsoft Office**. 

In the last three years I have been moving to more generic and less app specific formats for working. This inlcudes writing in **Markdown** and adopting a more mobile friendly workflows that include mobile and web applications like **Evernote**, **Dropbox** and **Google suite** of tools.
