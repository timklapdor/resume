Joined the Online Programs Team to coordinate the new design and development of online courses for the [Pearson Alliance](https://online.adelaide.edu.au/) and AdelaideX MOOCs. During this period the team developed the Alliance Quality Framework to set up clear standards for online course development. The first set of MOOCs that I lead the production of were [MathTrackX](https://www.edx.org/xseries/adelaidex-math-trackx) - a six course XSeries deliver on EdX that covers the core competencies required for entry into a range of university courses.
